This very **simple** and short program was created for educational purposes. It is my proposed solution to the "Bitmap Message" exerscise from the book "The Big Book of Small Python Projects". The task is described here:

My proposed solution does not use the enumerate() function and uses error handling in Python, which is important for the Python course I am working on.
